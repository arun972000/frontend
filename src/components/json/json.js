      "contentBottom":"Turin, Italy- Iveco Group., announces the selection of BASF SE., a chemical company and the largest chemical supplier for the automotive industry, as its first partner to provide a recycling solution for the lithium-ion batteries of the Group’s electric vehicles.\n\nThis choice is a component of the circular economy strategy implemented by Iveco Group, which uses the 4R Framework (Repair, Refurbish, Repurpose, and Recycling) to extend battery life while reducing environmental impact overall. Additionally, Iveco Group will guarantee adherence to the Extended Producer Responsibility policy, which holds manufacturers accountable for the whole life cycle of the products they introduce onto the market, from design to end-of-life.\n\nThe entire recycling process for the lithium-ion batteries used in the electric vans, buses, and trucks manufactured by the Iveco Group will be coordinated and managed by BASF, which recently opened the first co-located center of battery material production and recycling in Europe in Schwarzheide, Germany. The deal covers battery collection, packaging, shipping, and recycling across several European nations, including the UK, Germany, and France. Following collecting, the batteries will be mechanically processed by BASF into black mass, from which vital raw components, including lithium, cobalt, and nickel, can be recovered and extracted for use in the production of new batteries. In order to provide the battery sector locally with recycled metals that have a low carbon footprint, BASF will set up the entire battery recycling value chain in Europe.\n\nMs. Angela Qu, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Iveco Group. said that, We will be able to close the loop from end-of-life batteries to new ones with the assistance of BASF, which shares this strategy with us and has a wide battery collection network and recycling capabilities in Europe. Together, we can promote a circular economy and lessen our carbon footprint, both of which are essential to the Group's goal of net zero carbon by 2040.\n\nDr. Daniel Schönfelder, President of BASF’s Catalysts division, said that, Our partnership with Iveco Group is our first foray into recycling batteries from electric vans, buses, and trucks—an essential move for our battery recycling business to enter the commercial vehicle sector. [Include the name] is also in charge of the company’s battery materials and recycling business. This collaboration will strengthen our European collection network, advancing us in this growing market. Our recycling solutions aim to help the European market close the loop, aligning with the circular economy-focused policy requirements of the EU Battery Regulation.\n\nAbout BASF Battery Materials and Recycling\n\nBASF is a supplier of advanced cathode active materials (CAM) for the lithium-ion batteries market, providing high performance CAM to the world’s largest cell producers and for leading platforms of OEMs. In addition, we offer base metals sourcing and management as well as closed-loop battery recycling solutions. By leveraging our industry-leading R&D platforms and passion for innovation, BASF’s Battery Materials and Recycling unit develops unique, proprietary solutions that drive customer success."
